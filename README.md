This project is an AI Chatbot that uses OpenAI's GPT API to help student programmers figure out what their first projects can be.

The backend for this project was built using Python and the frontend was built using HTML/CSS and React.js.

At its current stage, this project is functional only when running locally. Deploying this has shown some issues that I'm in the process of trying to fix.
